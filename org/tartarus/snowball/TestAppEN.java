		String text = "Skoda Auto, more commonly known as Skoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer founded in 1895 as Laurin & Klement. It is headquartered in Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic. In 1925 Laurin & Klement was acquired by Skoda Works which itself became state owned during the days of the Communist government. After 1991 it was gradually privatized and in 2000 Skoda became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. Initially, the company was meant to serve the role of VW Groupâ€™s entry brand. Over time, however, the Skoda brand has shifted progressively more upmarket, with most models overlapping with their Volkswagen counterparts on price and features, while eclipsing them on space. Its total global sales reached 1.13 million cars in 2016 and had risen annually by 6.8 percent, profit rose by 6.5% in 2015.";
